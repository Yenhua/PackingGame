# PackingGame
2D Unity game based on 2D shape packing problems.

The objective of the game is to fit in as many shapes as possible into the container.

Current goals:
Implement a "playground" mode where the player can use any shape to move/rotate and place them into a container

Future plans:
Game modes consisting of limited and different shapes
Game modes with time constraints (Game modes with require a lot of balancing)
High Scores with game modes
Different size/shape of containers
